## Contributing

This project is an experiment for me.

I would love to see any modifications or refinements
musicians on the web come up with, but my taste is of
course subjective. If you do fork this project, please
open a PR, cheers!

I will open issues for tech related stuff, especially
for automating the engraving on releases. Any
contributions to that work is more than welcome.
I would also welcome any contributions to the beautification
of the sheet music itself. Lilypond appears feature rich
and it will take me a while to learn it.

I've added
[notes on writing music to the `/notes` directory](/notes/writing-music.md).
