# Writing Music

Disclaimer: This is a pragmatic approach to begin writing music for myself.
I'm aware that an infinite number of combination of things create harmony.

Music should begin and end on the same notes. For example: A waltz that
begins with `c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4` should end with `c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4`.
Using the same example, if a waltz in the relative minor
to `C`, `Am` began with `Am` `a4 <a c e>4 <a c e>4`, then it should end with `Am`
`a4 <a c e>4 <a c e>4`.

Musical expressions should contain an even number of measures. For example:
A waltz beginning with `cmaj` should begin with at least
`c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4 | c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4` and at most
`c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4 | c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4` x `y`.

## Hymns

When arranging hymns from the book, you will often be converting the original,
written for 2 voices in the left hand and 2 voices in the right, to an accordian
arrangment with 1 voice in the left hand and 3 voices in the right. Try to decrease
repeats and include all voices represented in the chord. For example, say no to
`<f, f a>` and say yes to `<f, c a>`. Use restraint, accordion hymns can be beautiful
without pulling all stops and using all the buttons. The voicings and harmonies
are where it's at.

The sound most similar to an organ would be LH or LM if the accordion doesn't have
piccolo. Use LM and play in the middle of keyboard. If you just use the clarinets
then the bass will overpower it.
