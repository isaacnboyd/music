# Writing Music

Disclaimer: This is a pragmatic approach to begin writing music for myself.
I'm aware that an infinite number of combination of things create harmony.

Music should begin and end on the same notes. For example: A waltz that
begins with `c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4` should end with `c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4`.
Using the same example, if a waltz in the relative minor
to `C`, `Am` began with `Am` `a4 <a c e>4 <a c e>4`, then it should end with `Am`
`a4 <a c e>4 <a c e>4`.

Musical expressions should contain an even number of measures. For example:
A waltz beginning with `cmaj` should begin with at least
`c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4 | c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4` and at most
`c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4 | c4 <c e g>4 <c e g>4` x `y`.
