## usage

I will execute releases periodically. These generate PDFs from
all `.ly` files in the repo. PDFs are downloadable under
[Releases](https://github.com/isaacnboyd/music/releases) in the
right hand column.

## contributing

There is a [contributing doc](/CONTRIBUTING.md) on the repo
and a [collection of notes](/etc/notes) on writing music as well.
[Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.24/Documentation/web/index)
docs are great.
